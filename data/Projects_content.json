A fillet was incorporated at cylinder edges to minimize electrostatic fringe effects, thus preserving the beam’s core integrity.

By employing an Einzel lens system composed of micron-scale silicon electrodes, electrostatic fields could precisely focus the electron beam without the need for bulky magnetic lenses, enabling a planar and stackable architecture ideal for miniaturized devices. These electrostatic lenses shape the beam through controlled potential gradients, minimizing aberrations while maintaining a tight focal spot. To support electron propagation in such confined geometries, getter-based ion-sorption pumps were used to sustain high vacuum (10⁻⁵ mbar) by adsorbing residual gas molecules, crucial for avoiding beam scattering and cathode degradation. However, despite vacuum conditions, trace air molecules can ionize under high-energy beam exposure and oxidize the CNT cathode tip, gradually altering emission characteristics, necessitating careful vacuum sealing and long-term cathode material stability."

          "content": "The analysis of beam quality post-focusing indicated that while the beam spot size of ~0.163 mm² at the focal point demonstrates effective lens action, some degradation in beam uniformity was noticeable. This was attributed to two main factors: beta-remittance and 1-RMS (root-mean-square) beam quality degradation. Beta-remittance refers to angular spread in emission trajectories due to the non-uniform surface potential of the CNT cathode, contributing to off-axis scattering and trajectory divergence. The 1-RMS beam quality measure, assessing spatial beam coherence, showed a slight increase in beam diameter variability beyond the focal plane, confirming low-level scattering and loss of focus precision. Despite these minor limitations, the MEMS electron microscope showcases a promising portable solution for localized high-resolution electron imaging, setting the foundation for further refinement in micro-lens shaping and emission control."

The formulation carefully accounts for translational and rotational kinetic energies, gravitational potential energies, and the coupling constraints imposed by the crank-slider geometry. Variables such as the crank angle, piston position, and connecting rod inclination were parametrized, and their time derivatives were systematically linked to evaluate the generalized velocities and accelerations."

Without wind, the PID controller maintained accurate trajectory tracking with minimal deviation across x, y, and z axes. The 3D trajectory plots revealed the quadrotor's path aligning closely with the reference, validating the PID’s responsiveness. Under wind disturbances, however, increased lag, overshoot, and instability were observed—especially in the lateral (x, y) motion. Z-axis (altitude) tracking remained relatively robust, likely due to higher derivative damping and less wind influence.

Proposed next steps include integrating feedforward control for anticipatory compensation, gain scheduling for mode-based tuning, and adaptive control to allow real-time adjustment of gains. Machine learning could also be leveraged to predict short-term environmental changes and adjust control strategies preemptively.

I worked alongside teams handling CNC machining operations for critical components like the hull and turret, using both vertical and horizontal machining centers. The hull segments, typically made from 8–15 mm thick armored steel (Jackal grade), were welded using MIG and Arc welding techniques. I also observed the use of TIG welding with argon shielding for lighter aluminum parts like exhaust covers and bonnet assemblies. These weldments were subjected to heat treatment around 250–280°C to relieve internal stresses and improve structural performance."

I participated in leak testing using pneumatic tools and soapy water inspection and observed how post-assembly tests such as dipping and sprinkling ensured amphibious sealing. Critical dimensional verification of the hull using Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) was also part of the workflow."

The turret assembly was also fitted with the NBC (Nuclear Biological & Chemical) protection system, onboard fire suppression lines, and compressed air-based engine starters. Before delivery, I got to observe full stationary testing procedures, such as engine preheat using glow plug chambers for high altitude operations, compressor cycling, and radiator airflow validation using ejector principles. This hands-on exposure gave me valuable insights into the integration of heavy mechanical, thermal, and control subsystems within an armored vehicle."
